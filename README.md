# ABM
R model for anaerobic microbial degradation (biodegradation) of organic matter with multiple microbial groups

# Description
The ABM model predicts conversion of animal manure or other high-moisture organic wastes to methane and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions.
The name comes from **a**naerobic **b**iodegradation **m**odel. 
With multiple microbial groups and group-specific parameters describing kinetics and yield, the model can predict realistic short- and long-term responses to temperature change.

# Installation
