# ABM
R model for anaerobic microbial degradation (biodegradation) of organic matter with multiple microbial groups

# Description
The ABM model predicts conversion of animal manure or other high-moisture organic wastes to methane and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions.
The name comes from **a**naerobic **b**iodegradation **m**odel. 
With multiple microbial groups and group-specific parameters describing kinetics and yield, the model can predict realistic short- and long-term responses to temperature change.

# Installation and getting started
This R package can be installed using `devtools::install_github("sashahafner/ABM", build_vignettes = TRUE)`.
Load the package with `library(ABM)`, and open up the vignette with `vignette("ABM_start")`.

If you have trouble installing ABM or devtools, make sure that you are working with the latest version of R. If you have updated R but still have trouble, please contact us or submit a new issue, explaining the problem.
