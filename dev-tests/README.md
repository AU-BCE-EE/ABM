# dev-tests
This subdirectory contains informal tests meant to be run after ABM package revisions.
To run all tests, run the script run_dev_tests.R in R.
Where it is possible and makes sense (where test results can easily be evaluated in an R expression), these tests should be moved to a proper formal test directory (as with tinytest).

# Subdirectories
